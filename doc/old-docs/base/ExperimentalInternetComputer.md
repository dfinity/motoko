# ExperimentalInternetComputer
Low-level interface to the Internet Computer.

**WARNING:** This low-level API is **experimental** and likely to change or even disappear.

## Value `call`
``` motoko no-repl
let call : (canister : Principal, name : Text, data : Blob) -> async (reply : Blob)
```

Calls ``canister``'s update or query function, `name`, with the binary contents of `data` as IC argument.
Returns the response to the call, an IC _reply_ or _reject_, as a Motoko future:

* The message data of an IC reply determines the binary contents of `reply`.
* The error code and textual message data of an IC reject determines the future's `Error` value.

Note: `call` is an asynchronous function and can only be applied in an asynchronous context.

Example:
```motoko no-repl
import IC "mo:base/ExperimentalInternetComputer";
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";

let ledger = Principal.fromText("ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai");
let method = "decimals";
let input = ();
type OutputType = { decimals : Nat32 };

let rawReply = await IC.call(ledger, method, to_candid(input)); // serialized Candid
let output : ?OutputType = from_candid(rawReply); // { decimals = 8 }
```

## Function `countInstructions`
``` motoko no-repl
func countInstructions(comp : () -> ()) : Nat64
```

Given computation, `comp`, counts the number of actual and (for IC system calls) notional WebAssembly
instructions performed during the execution of `comp()`.

More precisely, returns the difference between the state of the IC instruction counter (_performance counter_ `0`) before and after executing `comp()`
(see [Performance Counter](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-performance-counter)).

NB: `countInstructions(comp)` will _not_ account for any deferred garbage collection costs incurred by `comp()`.

Example:
```motoko no-repl
import IC "mo:base/ExperimentalInternetComputer";

let count = IC.countInstructions(func() {
  // ...
});
```

## Value `performanceCounter`
``` motoko no-repl
let performanceCounter : (counter : Nat32) -> (value : Nat64)
```

Returns the current value of IC _performance counter_ `counter`.

* Counter `0` is the _current execution instruction counter_, counting instructions only since the beginning of the current IC message.
  This counter is reset to value `0` on shared function entry and every `await`.
  It is therefore only suitable for measuring the cost of synchronous code.

* Counter `1` is the _call context instruction counter_  for the current shared function call.
  For replicated message executing, this excludes the cost of nested IC calls (even to the current canister).
  For non-replicated messages, such as composite queries, it includes the cost of nested calls.
  The current value of this counter is preserved across `awaits` (unlike counter `0`).

* The function (currently) traps if `counter` >= 2.

Consult [Performance Counter](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-performance-counter) for details.

Example:
```motoko no-repl
import IC "mo:base/ExperimentalInternetComputer";

let c1 = IC.performanceCounter(1);
work();
let diff : Nat64 = IC.performanceCounter(1) - c1;
```

## Function `replyDeadline`
``` motoko no-repl
func replyDeadline() : Nat
```

Returns the time (in nanoseconds from the epoch start) by when the update message should
reply to the best effort message so that it can be received by the requesting canister.
Queries and non-best-effort update messages return zero.
