# Prelude
General utilities

belong in the _language_ (compiler-internal) prelude sometime, after
some further experience and discussion.  Until then, they live here.

trap in all execution contexts.

## Function `xxx`
`func xxx() : None`


## Function `unreachable`
`func unreachable() : None`

Mark unreachable code with the `unreachable` function.

Calls are well-typed in all typing contexts, and they
