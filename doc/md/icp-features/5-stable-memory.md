# Stable memory and regions

Canisters have two types of storage: Wasm memory and stable memory. The Wasm memory is often referred to as the [heap memory](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#heap-memory). It is automatically used for heap-allocated objects and has a maximum size limitation of 4 GiB or 6 GiB respective to whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit heap storage without enhanced orthogonal persistence. When a canister is upgraded, the heap memory is cleared, only retaining data stored in stable variables.

Stable memory has a maximum size of 500 GiB and is preserved across canister upgrades. Motoko utilizes [stable memory](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#stable-memory) through the [stable storage feature](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/storage#motoko-storage-handling) to preserve data across canister upgrades. Stable regions extend this functionality to allow more structured and flexible memory management.

The system automatically commits all memory modifications, both Wasm and stable, after the successful execution of a message. If a message execution fails, the changes are not committed.

:::caution
The `Regions` library should only be used if [enhanced orthogonal persistence](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/orthogonal-persistence/modes) does not fit your use case.

## What is a `Region`?

A [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) is an isolated chunk of stable memory that can be allocated, grown, and managed independently. It functions like a dedicated section of storage, ensuring that its contents remain separate and inaccessible to other parts of the program.

Each [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) has a starting address, a current size, and can grow dynamically. One could think of a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) similarly to an array, where each position corresponds to an index and data is accessed through byte offsets. However, unlike a traditional array, memory management within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) is manual, requiring explicit tracking of space usage and current position to ensure accurate data access and storage.

### Pages

A **page** is the fundamental unit of allocation in stable memory, serving as the building block for memory management. Each page has a fixed size of 64 KiB (`65_536` bytes) and is zero-initialized upon allocation, ensuring a clean state before use. Pages are accessed using [byte offsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_(computer_science)) for precise control over memory operations.

### Blocks

A **block** is the physical allocation unit used by the ICP runtime system to manage stable memory. Each block consists of 128 stable memory pages, effectively grouping allocations into larger chunks. While memory can be allocated at the page level, the system internally allocates at the block level, meaning memory is reserved in increments of 128 pages. This approach optimizes resource management and reduces fragmentation while maintaining the flexibility of page-level access.

### Position and offsets

An **offset** represents a specific byte position within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region), starting from `0`. It is used to locate data within the allocated memory space. Positions within a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) are calculated using `current_position + bytes_used`, ensuring proper tracking of where new data should be written or read.

Since stable memory does not inherently manage layout, it is the developer’s responsibility to keep track of what data is stored at each offset.

## Using a `Region`

It is the developer's responsibility to properly manipulate and interpret the data within a regions structure, which may be error-prone. However, the safety of Motoko's native value heap objects is always guaranteed, independent of the stable [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) content. The cost of accessing stable regions is significantly higher than using Motoko's native memory.

### Creation and allocation

A new [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) is created using `Region.new()`, initializing it with a size of 0 pages. The current size can be checked with `Region.size(myRegion)`, which returns the number of allocated pages. To expand the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region), use `Region.grow(myRegion, X)`, where `X` is the number of pages to be added. The function will return the previous size before expansion, allowing verification of successful growth. If the operation fails due to memory constraints, it will return `0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF`, indicating that no additional memory could be allocated.

```motoko no-repl
// Create a new region of initial size 0
let myRegion = Region.new();

// Check the current size (in pages)
let currentSizeInPages = Region.size(myRegion);  // Initially 0

// Grow the region by adding pages
// Returns previous size on success, returns 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF on failure
let previousSize = Region.grow(myRegion, 10);  // Add 10 pages (640 KiB)
```

### Growing a `Region` safely

`Regions` can only grow, never shrink. Growth may fail due to [ICP resource limitations](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/canister-management/resource-limits) and it is recommended to use the minimum pages needed to conserve resources.

Growing a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) safely requires checking the current allocated size and ensuring that the required space does not exceed available capacity. Since stable memory is allocated in fixed-size pages of 64 KiB, any expansion must be done in page increments. To determine how many additional pages are needed, the difference between the required memory and the current capacity is calculated and rounded up to the nearest page boundary. Once the necessary pages are determined, the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) is expanded accordingly. After growth, verifying that the expansion was successful ensures stability and prevents unintended memory access issues.

```motoko no-repl
 // Helper function to ensure a region has enough space
func ensureCapacity(r : Region, requiredBytes : Nat64) {
  let currentPages = Region.size(r);
  let bytesPerPage : Nat64 = 65536;
  let currentCapacity = currentPages * bytesPerPage;
  
  if (requiredBytes > currentCapacity) {
    // Calculate how many new pages we need
    let additionalBytesNeeded = requiredBytes - currentCapacity;
    let pagesNeeded = (additionalBytesNeeded + bytesPerPage - 1) / bytesPerPage;
    
    // Grow the region and check the result
    let result = Region.grow(r, pagesNeeded);
    assert result == currentPages; // Verify growth succeeded
  };
}
```

### Reading and writing data

Since stable memory does not inherently manage data structure layouts, offsets must be tracked manually to ensure correct placement and retrieval of values.

Smaller data types, such as an 8-bit naturals ([`Nat8`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Nat8)), can be written and retrieved from a designated offset. The chosen offset determines where in the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) the value is stored.

```motoko no-repl
// Store an 8-bit value at offset 0
Region.storeNat8(myRegion, 0, 42);

// Read the 8-bit value from offset 0
let value = Region.loadNat8(myRegion, 0);  // Returns 42
```

Larger values, such as [`Nat64`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Nat64), require multiple bytes for storage. Allocating offsets with enough space prevents overlapping data.

In this example, the 64-bit integer is stored at offset `100` to ensure it has sufficient space.

```motoko no-repl
// Store a 64-bit value at offset 100
Region.storeNat64(myRegion, 100, 123456789);

// Read the 64-bit value from offset 100
let longValue = Region.loadNat64(myRegion, 100);  // Returns 123456789
```

Floating-point numbers can also be stored in a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region). Since these values occupy multiple bytes, offsets should be spaced accordingly to avoid overwriting adjacent data.

```motoko no-repl
// Store a floating-point value at offset 200
Region.storeFloat(myRegion, 200, 3.14159);

// Read the floating-point value from offset 200
let pi = Region.loadFloat(myRegion, 200);  // Returns 3.14159
```

Regions can be used for storing and retrieving binary data as `Blob`s. This is useful for handling arbitrary sequences of bytes, such as serialized objects or encoded information.

`Blob`s can be stored at any offset, but their size must be considered when choosing a starting position. Retrieving the correct number of bytes ensures that data integrity is maintained when working with binary storage in a [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region).

```motoko no-repl
// Create a blob
let myData = Blob.fromArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Store the blob at offset 300
Region.storeBlob(myRegion, 300, myData);

// Read 5 bytes from offset 300
let retrievedData = Region.loadBlob(myRegion, 300, 5);  // Returns the same blob
```

### Mops packages for Regions

- [`memory-region`](https://mops.one/memory-region]): A library for abstraction over the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) type that supports reusing deallocated memory.

- [`stable-enum`](https://mops.one/stable-enum): Enumerations implemented in stable regions.

- [`stable-buffer`](https://mops.one/stable-buffer): Buffers implemented in stable regions.


## `Regions` comprehensive example

This example illustrates the simultaneous use of stable variables and stable memory. It uses a single stable variable, `state`, to keep track of the two regions and their size in bytes, but stores the contents of the log directly in stable memory.

```motoko no-repl
import Nat64 "mo:core/Nat64";
import Region "mo:core/Region";

persistent actor StableLog {

  // Index of saved log entry.
  public type Index = Nat64;

  // Internal representation uses two regions, working together.
  var state = { // implicitly `stable`
    bytes = Region.new();
    var bytes_count : Nat64 = 0;
    elems = Region.new ();
    var elems_count : Nat64 = 0;
  };

  // Grow a region to hold a certain number of total bytes.
  func regionEnsureSizeBytes(r : Region, new_byte_count : Nat64) {
    let pages = Region.size(r);
    if (new_byte_count > pages << 16) {
      let new_pages = ((new_byte_count + ((1 << 16) - 1)) / (1 << 16)) - pages;
      assert Region.grow(r, new_pages) == pages
    }
  };

  // Element = Position and size of a saved a Blob.
  type Elem = {
    pos : Nat64;
    size : Nat64;
  };

  transient let elem_size = 16 : Nat64; /* two Nat64s, for pos and size. */

  // Count of elements (Blobs) that have been logged.
  public func size() : async Nat64 {
      state.elems_count
  };

  // Constant-time random access to previously-logged Blob.
  public func get(index : Index) : async Blob {
    assert index < state.elems_count;
    let pos = Region.loadNat64(state.elems, index * elem_size);
    let size = Region.loadNat64(state.elems, index * elem_size + 8);
    let elem = { pos ; size };
    Region.loadBlob(state.bytes, elem.pos, Nat64.toNat(elem.size))
  };

  // Add Blob to the log, and return the index of it.
  public func add(blob : Blob) : async Index {
    let elem_i = state.elems_count;
    state.elems_count += 1;

    let elem_pos = state.bytes_count;
    state.bytes_count += Nat64.fromNat(blob.size());

    regionEnsureSizeBytes(state.bytes, state.bytes_count);
    Region.storeBlob(state.bytes, elem_pos, blob);

    regionEnsureSizeBytes(state.elems, state.elems_count * elem_size);
    Region.storeNat64(state.elems, elem_i * elem_size + 0, elem_pos);
    Region.storeNat64(state.elems, elem_i * elem_size + 8, Nat64.fromNat(blob.size()));
    elem_i
  }
};
```


## Troubleshooting

Stable memory management can introduce issues such as out-of-bounds access, growth failures, and data corruption.

One common error is `accessing memory beyond allocated limits`, leading to out-of-bounds access. This occurs when attempting to read or write data beyond the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region)’s current size. To prevent this, always ensure the [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) has been expanded sufficiently before performing operations.

A [`Region`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core/Region) may also fail to grow when calling `Region.grow()`, returning `0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` instead of the previous size. This typically indicates that the stable memory limit has been reached. Implementing fallback strategies or optimizing memory usage can help mitigate this issue.

Data corruption can occur when memory layouts are mismanaged, resulting in unintended overwrites. Proper bounds checking and structured memory layouts help prevent this problem, ensuring that stored data remains intact.

### Debugging

Tracking memory usage is essential for preventing overflow and inefficiencies. Keeping counters for allocated vs. used memory helps detect excessive usage before it leads to failures. Assertions can be placed in key areas of the code to verify that offset calculations remain within valid bounds.

To ensure data integrity, checksums can be implemented to detect corruption, allowing verification of whether stored data has been altered unexpectedly. Additionally, placing known markers at structure boundaries helps identify memory misalignment and debugging inconsistencies.
