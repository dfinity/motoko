# Control flow

Control flow determines the order in which a program executes its instructions. It directs the path of execution based on conditions and decisions.

By default, code follows **sequential execution**, running line by line. **Conditional statements** allow the program to execute different code based on conditions, **loops** (for, while) repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition remains true. **Function calls** enable the program to jump to a separate block of code to perform a specific task before returning to the original execution point.
