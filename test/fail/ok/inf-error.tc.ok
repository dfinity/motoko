because implicit instantiation of type parameter `K` is over-constrained with
  Any  <:  K  <:  Nat
where
  Any  </:  Nat
so that no valid instantiation exists

  (Any, Any) -> Order
Hint: If you're trying to omit an implicit argument named `compare` you need to have a matching declaration named `compare` in scope.
