(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0216], the new type of stable variable `one` implicitly drops data of the previous version. 
 The previous type
  var {field : Nat}
 is not a stable subtype of
  var {} because: Missing field `field` in type 
  {}
 of `one`.
 The data can only be dropped by an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0216], the new type of stable variable `two` implicitly drops data of the previous version. 
 The previous type
  var Nat
 is not a stable subtype of
  var Any because: Converting 
  Nat
 to `Any` is disallowed as it leads to data loss
 in `two`.
 The data can only be dropped by an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
