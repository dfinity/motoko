(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0170], the new type of stable variable `products` is not compatible with the previous version.
 The previous type
  var {root : Tree<Text, Product>; size : Nat}
 is not a subtype of
  Map<Text, OldProduct> = {root : Tree<Text, OldProduct>; size : Nat}
 because case `#caffeine` is missing from expected type 
  {
    #crypto;
    #defi;
    #growth;
    #identity;
    #infrastructure;
    ...
    #research;
    #runtime;
    #sdk;
    #security;
    #storage
  }
 of `OldTeam` (used by `team` in `OldProduct` in `Tree` in `root` in `Map` in `products`).
 Write an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
