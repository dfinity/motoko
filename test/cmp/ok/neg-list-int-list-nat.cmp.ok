(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0170], the new type of stable variable ln is not compatible to the previous program version.
 The previous type
  List<Int> = ?(Int, List<Int>)
 is not a subtype of
  List<Nat> = ?(Nat, List<Nat>)
 because:
 Cannot implicitly convert 
  Int
 to 
  Nat
 in Nat (used by List in ln).
 Write an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
