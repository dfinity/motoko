ingress Err: IC0504: Error from Canister rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai: Canister violated contract: function invocation does not match its signature.
If you are running this canister in a test environment (e.g., dfx), make sure the test environment is up to date. Otherwise, this is likely an error with the compiler/CDK toolchain being used to build the canister. Please report the error to IC devs on the forum: https://forum.dfinity.org and include which language/CDK was used to create the canister.
