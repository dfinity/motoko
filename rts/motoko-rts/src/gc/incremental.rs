//! Incremental evacuation-compacting GC.
//!
//! Properties:
//! - All GC pauses have bounded short time.
//! - Full-heap snapshot-at-the-beginning marking.
//! - Focus on reclaiming high-garbage partitions.
//! - Compacting heap space with partition evacuations.
//! - Incremental copying enabled by forwarding pointers.
//!
//! The entire GC state including the scheduling statistics must be
//! retained across upgrades and therefore be stored part of the
