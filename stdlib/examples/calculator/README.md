Calculators
===========
Author(s): Matthew Hammer, ...

Show examples of a (very simple) DSL for a (very simple) Motoko application.

The complexity of these examples are at the level of a talk or technical demo: 
Simple, but instructive of how one could build and structure larger applications.

- `calc0` gives the most basic version as a single actor (class)
- `calc1` introduces a datatype for the calculator-instructions DSL
- `calc2` introduces a separate, purely-functional component for the DSL
- `calc3` introduces logging; the log stores the DSL instructions and the associated results/errors
