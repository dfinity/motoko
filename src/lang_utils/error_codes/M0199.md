# M0199

This error means that your code is either directly or indirectly using the now deprecated library `ExperimentalStableMemory.mo`.

The library works but is a potential security hazard as the resource it provides access to is shared between all clients of the library.
This means that a library may unintentionally or maliciously read or modify data maintained by your application or another library used by your application.

Please upgrade your code to use library `Region.mo` instead.
This improved library offers a similar abstraction, but instead of a single memory that is implicilty shared and accessible to all comers, it provides multiple memories.
These memories, called regions, are isolated from each other and inaccessible unless explicitly shared.

If your application cannot easily be upgraded to use `Regions.mo` and still requires access to `ExperimentalStableMemory.mo`, you can opt-in to legacy support for `ExpirementalStableMemory.mo` using the `moc` compiler flag `--legacy-experimental-stable-memory`.
The flag disables this error message, allowing your code to compile as before.
