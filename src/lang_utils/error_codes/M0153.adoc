The word types (`Word8` etc.) are deprecated, please use `Nat8` or `Int8` and friends
instead. Things to keep in mind:

 * The operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `**` were warpping on word types. To get the
   same behaviour on `NatN` and `IntN` types, use the wrapping variants (`+%`,
   `-%`, `*%` and `**%`)

 * On word types, there are two shift operators (`>>` and `+>>`). In the
   future, there is only `>>`, and the signedness depends on the signedness of
   the underlying type.

 * You can use `.vals()` instead of `.bytes()` on blobs to get a `Nat8`-valued
   iterator.
