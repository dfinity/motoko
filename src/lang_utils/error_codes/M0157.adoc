= M0157

This error means that a type definition, or set of type definitions, is ill-defined.

Motoko rejects type definitions that are _non-productive_.

A type is productive if expanding any outermost type applications in its body eventually
produces a type other the application of another definition.

For example, the type definitions:

  type Person = { first : Text; last : Text };

  type List<T> = ?(T, List<T>);

  type Fst<T, U> = T;

  type Ok<T> = Fst<Any, OK<T>>;

are all productive, and accepted by the compiler.


But the type definitions:

  type C = C;

  type D<T,U> = D<U, T>;

  type E<T> = F<T>;
  type F<T> = E<T>;

  type G<T> = Fst<G<T>, Any>;

are all non-productive, since each definition will enter a loop after one or more
expansions of its body.

If you encounter this error, try to restructure your type definitions to be productive.
