# M0216

This error occurs when you reference a package in a `--override` argument that has not been defined with a `--package` argument.

The `--override` flag allows you to redirect package dependencies within specific directories, but both the original package and the override package must be defined using `--package`.

## Common cause

You are using `--override` with a package name that was not previously defined with `--package`.

Erroneous command line example:

```bash
moc --package mylib ./libs/mylib --override ./src mylib otherlib main.mo
#                                                      ^^^^^^^^
# Error: package "otherlib" is not defined with --package
```

## Solution

Make sure all packages referenced in your `--override` arguments are first defined with `--package`:

```bash
moc --package mylib ./libs/mylib \
    --package otherlib ./libs/otherlib \
    --override ./src mylib otherlib \
    main.mo
```

In this corrected example:
- `mylib` is defined to point to `./libs/mylib`
- `otherlib` is defined to point to `./libs/otherlib`  
- Within `./src`, imports of `mylib` will be resolved to `otherlib` instead

Both the original package (`mylib`) and the override package (`otherlib`) must be defined with `--package` for the override to work.
