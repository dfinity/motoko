= M0154

You are using a field (typically a module field) that has a warning annotation
attached to its definition, e.g.

  module SomeModule {

    public("The foo function is deprecated and will be removed next release")
       func foo() {}

  }

The warnign should include an explanation provided by the author of that code.
