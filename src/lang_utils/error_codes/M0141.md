# M0141

This error indicates that the main actor or actor class has some leading or trailing declarations that are not just `import` declarations.

The offending declarations should be moved into the body of the main actor or actor class.

Here's an offending code example:

```motoko
import Int "mo:base/Int";

// illegal leading declarations before main actor
type Point = (Int, Int);
let origin : Point = (0, 0);

actor {

  public func getOrigin() : async Point { origin };

}
```

This is a possible correction of the code:

```motoko
import Int "mo:base/Int";

actor {

  // legal leading declarations within main actor
  type Point = (Int, Int);
  let origin : Point = (0, 0);

  public func getOrigin() : async Point { origin };

}
```
