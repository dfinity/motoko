(*
This module provides some convenience to assemble WASM instruction lists. The
features are

 * O(1) concatenation (using difference list internally)
 * Managing of label depths.
 * Some simple peephole optimizations.

(* Note [emit a DW_TAG]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are two principal types of DWARF tags, those
   which are intimately tied to the generated instructions
   and those that are not. The latter ones include type
   definitions which can be regarded as global, while
   the former bracket or delimit instructions, like
   scoping or variable definitions. These are required to
   float with the instruction stream.

   Another aspect of tags is whether a tag admits children.
   When it admits children, these follow sequentially,
   closed by dw_tag_close. The abbreviation table must
   be consulted when deciding between
   - dw_tag_no_children, or
   - dw_tag.
   The former is self-closing (no nested tags), and the
   latter is high-level, straddling a region of code.
   The low-level alternative to the latter is using the
   dw_tag_open/dw_tag_close pair explicitly to demarcate
   the enclosed instructions. This moves the burden of
   balancing to the user.
   See also: Note [funneling DIEs through Wasm.Ast]
 *)

(* Note [locations for types]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Motoko uses a variety of formats to store data depending on its type
   and even the actual value. Location  expressions are necessary to teach
   the debugger where the data can be found.
   - For short numeric types we have a location expression that LSB-aligns
     and leaves the value on the expression stack. This is a workaround for
     `lldb`'s insufficiency to understand basic types that are bitfields
     (http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2020-August/016393.html).
     This also implies that setting of such variables in `lldb` won't work.
   - 32/64 bit-sized integrals may be stored on the heap, we use `DW_OP_bra`
     to guide the debugger after examining the indirection bit.
     We can't use the pointer key to be a discriminator for DW_TAG_variant_part
     because of lldb (link above), and probably displaying issues.
   - For arbitrary-precision integrals, we cannot inspect the multi-precision
     heap representation yet
   - Variants with no payload map to C-like `enum`s, the location expression
     takes care of focussing on the hash value
   - Variants map to `DW_TAG_variant_*` directly
   - Tuples may use Rust-like decoding
   - Objects need field search for members (when encoded as structure members)
   - The `Any` type will need fully dynamic resolution by `lldb`
   - Parameter types for polymorphic types/functions will be treated as `Any`.
   - `Text` will be treated as `Any` as it needs pretty-printing in the presence
     of concatenation nodes
