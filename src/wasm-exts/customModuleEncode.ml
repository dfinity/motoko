(*
This module originated as a copy of interpreter/binary/encode.ml in the
reference implementation.

The changes are:
 * Support for writing out a source map for the Code parts
 * Support for additional custom sections

The code is otherwise as untouched as possible, so that we can relatively
easily apply diffs from the original code (possibly manually).
 *)

(* Note [funneling DIEs through Wasm.Ast]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DWARF debugging information entry (DIE) is a simple data carrier meant
to be transmitted in a sequential fashion. Here, DIEs are attached to
specially crafted instructions (Meta) in the instruction stream
that is derived from the Wasm.Ast. Since these instructions are inserted artificially
and are not intended for execution, they will not be emitted as instructions, but
aggregated, correlated and finally output into DWARF sections of the binary.
DIEs are defined in Dwarf5.Meta and can be recognised via the `is_dwarf_like` predicate.
When extracted from the instruction stream using the predicate, we can check whether
they are a tag (pre-filled) with attributes/subtags or free-standing attributes that will
end up in the last tag. Similarly later tags nest into open tags. The larger-scale hierarchical
structure is finally restored when all instructions are emitted. The mechanism is described in
the blog post http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/29/an-interesting-tree-serialization-algorithm-from-dwarf

 *)


(* Note [bubbling up types in the tag hierarchy]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Certain DIEs (precisely `DW_TAG_*`s) can be referenced from attributes
by means of position in the `.debug_info` section. E.g. types are referenced
from a variety of DIEs. But since we generate DIEs for types on the fly,
they end up at the same hierarchy level as the referencing DIE. Such references
are allocated serially by extending a mapping to promises. The promise gets
fulfilled when the prerequisite DIE is externalised into the section.
To have every referencable tag a fulfilled section position, on the tag closing
trigger we move every referencable DIE out of it and into the parent, effectively
bubbling all up to toplevel. Then, immediately before externalising the DIE tree,
we perform a stable sort by serial number, with non-referencable DIEs trailing.

 *)

(* Note [placeholder promises for typedefs]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When forming the DIE for a Motoko type synonym (`type List = ...`)
we need to do something special. Since such typedefs are cycle-breakers
in the type system, we will need to adopt the same property in the
`.debug_info` section too. So, we'll output `DW_TAG_typedef` before
even knowing which type it refers to. Instead we use a DW_FORM_ref4
for its `DW_AT_type` attribute, which is backpatchable. The value of this
attribute is an integer, pointing to a fulfilled promise created when the
DIE was formed. It got fulfilled when the typedef's type became known,
another DIE, formed shortly after the typedef's. Resolving this fulfilled
promise in turn gives us the index (actual type ref) of an unfulfilled
promise (the forward reference). This forward reference will be fulfilled
to be a byte offset in the section as soon as the corresponding DIE is emitted.

We keep a function that performs the patching of the section (before it is
written to disk) by overwriting the preliminary bytes in `DW_TAG_typedef`'s
`DW_AT_type` with the now fulfilled offset obtained from the forward reference.
